## Recolor Help
Inside the root of the file (can be found in `./index.scss` on powercord, other platforms it will just be in the file) you can mess with the values as you like. They are done in an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) format, so I recommend using [google's colorpicker](https://www.google.com/search?q=colorpicker) to get your desired colors. All button colors are sorted by their color.
